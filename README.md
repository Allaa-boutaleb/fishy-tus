## 🔍 Overview

This repository provides a unified and clean implementation for evaluating Table Union Search benchmarks. The code supports a standardized structure across different datasets and enables reproducible experiments with minimal configuration.  

We have repackaged all datasets in a unified format for **ease of use**. However, **original benchmark data must be processed and formatted** according to our schema before use — including file restructuring, query sampling, and in some cases additional cleaning.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and prepare the benchmarks.

### 1. Set Up the Environment

Create and activate the environment:

```bash
conda create -n tus_benchmarks python=3.12 -y
conda activate tus_benchmarks
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download the Benchmarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🧳 To quickly get started, download all the processed benchmarks from Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15499092.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15499092). This archive includes all benchmarks preprocessed and formatted as required by this repository. All you have to do is extract them into the `data/` folder.

Alternatively, you can obtain the **original datasets** from the authors’ repositories. However, **you will need to preprocess them**:

- Convert them into our unified format (`datalake/`, `query/`, `benchmark.pkl`)
- Sample query tables for **TUS-SMALL** and **TUS-LARGE**
- Apply further cleaning and structure enforcement for **LakeBench OpenData** and **WebTable**

Original links of benchmarks:

- **SANTOS:** [northeastern-datalab/santos](https://github.com/northeastern-datalab/santos)
- **TUS-SMALL / TUS-LARGE:** [RJMillerLab/table-union-search-benchmark](https://github.com/RJMillerLab/table-union-search-benchmark)
- **PYLON:** [superctj/pylon](https://github.com/superctj/pylon/tree/main)
- **UGEN-V1 / UGEN-V2:** [northeastern-datalab/gen](https://github.com/northeastern-datalab/gen)
- **LB-OPENDATA / LB-WEBTABLE:** [RLGen/LakeBench](https://github.com/RLGen/LakeBench)

Expected structure:

```
data/
└── benchmark_name/
    ├── datalake/      # CSV tables from the data lake
    ├── query/         # CSV query tables
    └── benchmark.pkl  # Python dict {query_name: [candidate_1, candidate_2, ...]}
```

📝 Notes:
- `TUS-SMALL` and `TUS-LARGE` include the **sampled query subsets** used in our experiments, located under the `query/` directory. These were selected from the full benchmark to match our experimental setup.  
  ➤ You can still access **all original queries** from both benchmarks in the `all_query/` folder available in the archives listed in [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15224451).
  
- `LB-OPENDATA` and `LB-WEBTABLE` have undergone **extensive preprocessing** to ensure consistency and usability:
  - Tables from the data lake that are **not referenced** in the ground truth were removed.
  - Ground truth entries pointing to **missing candidate tables** were also filtered out.
  - For each query, the **query table itself was added as a candidate** to maintain consistency across benchmarks.
  - For `LB-OPENDATA`, we additionally provide a **reduced version** where each table is truncated to a **maximum of 1,000 rows**, allowing for more efficient experimentation.
### 3. Run Experiments

To run a benchmark using the selected methods:

```bash
python run.py BENCHMARK_NAME [--methods METHOD1 METHOD2 ...] [--k K_VALUE] [--limit LIMIT] [--exclude-self-matches]
```

Example:

```bash
python run.py santos --methods hash tfidf count sbert --k 10
```

The output will include:
- Vector files in `vectors/`
- Ranking results in `results/`

## 📂 Datasets

All datasets used in our study follow the same directory structure and format. If you use the provided Zenodo archive, everything will be ready to go. If using original datasets:

- Follow the format explained in [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- Consult original documentation for preprocessing steps

---

## 📊 Profiling

You can analyze the structure of any benchmark (e.g., query-candidate overlaps, attribute statistics) using the scripts in the [`profiler/`](./profiler/) folder. See the README inside for usage examples.

    abstract = "Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of progress in semantic table union search."
